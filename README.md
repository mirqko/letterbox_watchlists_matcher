# Letterbox watchlists matchers

Tool used to find common movies among the watchlists of a list of users


Letterbox APIs are not publicly available, so i've made a scraper that browse through users' profiles and collects the movies from their watchlists.
The scraper heavily relies on how the html of users' profiles is structured, so if it gets updated, the tool might stop working.
